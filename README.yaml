  Terraform module to provision a scheduled Lambda function which will
  delete old Elasticsearch indexes using [SigV4Auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) authentication. The
  lambda function can optionally send output to an SNS topic if the
  topic ARN is given. This module was largely inspired by
  [aws-lambda-es-cleanup](https://github.com/cloudreach/aws-lambda-es-cleanup)
usage: |2-

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  module "elasticsearch_cleanup" {
    source               = "https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup.git?ref=master"
    es_endpoint          = module.elasticsearch.domain_endpoint
    es_domain_arn        = module.elasticsearch.domain_arn
    es_security_group_id = module.elasticsearch.security_group_id
    vpc_id               = module.vpc.vpc_id
    namespace            = "eg"
    stage                = "dev"
    schedule             = "cron(0 3 * * ? *)"
  }
  ```

  Indexes are expected to be in the format `name-date` where `date` is in the format specified by `var.index_format`.
  By default, all indexes except for the ones added by Kibana will be deleted based on the date part of the full
  index name. The actual creation date of the index is not used.

  Index matching is done with unanchored regular expresssion, so "bar" matches index "foobarbaz".

  - If the full index name, including the date part, matches `skip_index_re`, then the index will be skipped (never deleted).
    Kibana indexes are skipped by the default `skip_index_re` of `^\.kibana*` so if you specify a value for `skip_index_re`
    you must include the Kibana exception in your regex if you want it excepted. (Since Kibana indexes do not have a
    date part, this module should not delete them, but will complain about them having malformed dates if they are not excluded.)
  - If the index name without the trailing `-date` part matches `index_re`, then it will be cleaned up according to the date part.

  Keep in mind that, fundamentally, this module expects indexes to be in the format of `name-date` so it will not work
  properly if the regexes end up selecting an index that does not end with `-date`. To avoid edge cases, it is wise not
  to include dashes in your index name or date format.

  ## Migration

  Prior to version 0.10.0, this moudle had inputs `index`, which was a comma-separated list of index names or the
  special name "all" to indicate all but Kibana indexes, and `index_regex`, which was a regular expression for parsing
  index name and date parts. There was no mechanism for specifying a list of indexes to exclude.
  Starting with version 0.10.0 this module drops those inputs and instead takes `index_re` and `skip_index_re`,
  both of which are regular expressions. (You probably want to anchor your regexes to the beginning of the index name
  by starting with `^`).

  | If you previously had | Now use |
  |----------------------|----------|
  |`index = "all"`| Default values for `index_re` and `skip_index_re`|
  |`index = "a,xb,c0"` | `index_re = "^(a\|xb\|c0)"` and `skip_index_re = "^$"`|
  |`index_regex = "(ipat)-(dpat)"`|`index_re = "ipat"` and be sure `index_format` is correct for your date format|
