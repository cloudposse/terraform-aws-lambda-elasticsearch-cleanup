# terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-lambda-elasticsearch-cleanup/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision a scheduled Lambda function which will 
delete old Elasticsearch indexes using [SigV4Auth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html) authentication. The
lambda function can optionally send output to an SNS topic if the 
topic ARN is given. This module was largely inspired by 
[aws-lambda-es-cleanup](https://github.com/cloudreach/aws-lambda-es-cleanup)
